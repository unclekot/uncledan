                      <h4>Our Story</h4>
                      <p>Our founders Albert & Sarah married in July of 2013 and headed to Canada for their honeymoon. As they wandered through Quebec City, they came upon a French bistro that served cucumber water. It was wonderfully refreshing and they stockpiled it in their water bottles for the rest of the trip. After they traveled back to Texas, they searched for something similar but there were simply no good options; so the idea for Sway was started.</p>
